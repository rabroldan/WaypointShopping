# WaypointShopping - Read Me

Welcome to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, initiated with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To kickstart your development server, execute the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to witness the initial result.

Begin editing the page by modifying the `pages/index.js` file. The page automatically updates as you edit.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) are accessible at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Modify this endpoint in the `pages/api/hello.js` file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`, treating files here as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for automatic optimization and loading of Inter, a custom Google Font.
